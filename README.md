# Email API

This project was built using the book "Zero to Production in Rust" by Luca Palmieri. It serves as an exercis for me to build a production web API in Rust.

## Getting started

Run the following command to start the program with a useful testing / watch dev cycle:

```
cargo watch -x check -x test -x run
```
